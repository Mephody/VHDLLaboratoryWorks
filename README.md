# VHDLLaboratoryWorks
A couple of VHDL laboratory works.

I made this projects not so long ago, smth like 2 years ago (september 2016 - january 2016).

There is a source code in there, so you just need to compile projects in any VHDL running program you like (QuestaSIM, ModelSIM, Xilinx IDE, Vivado or any others).

1. lb1 - simple starting project, which can help you to understand main structures of language;
2. lb2 - a little bit more complex scheme;
3. lb3 - generate-like scheme (2 different variations);
4. lb4 - trigger defenition and finite state machine defenition;
5. lb5 - functions and procedures.

I hope this will help you in your studies. =)
