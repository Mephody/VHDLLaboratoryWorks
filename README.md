# VHDLLaboratoryWorks
A couple of VHDL laboratory works.

I made this projects not so long ago, smth like 2 years ago (september 2016 - january 2016).

There is a source code in there, so you just need to compile projects in any VHDL running program you like (QuestaSIM, ModelSIM, Xilinx IDE, Vivado or any others).

1. lb1 - simple starting project, which can help you to understand main structures of language;
  main module - model1
  test module - test_module1
2. lb2 - a little bit more complex scheme;
  main module - sxema
  test module - test, test1
3. lb3 - generate-like scheme (2 different variations);
  main module - sx2p1, sx2p2
  test module - test1, test2
4. lb4 - trigger defenition and finite state machine defenition;
For FSM:
  main module - mili 
  test module - test 
For Trigger:
  main module - tfun, tstr
  test module - testtrigger
5. lb5 - functions and procedures.
  main module - model
  test module - test

There is more detailed explanations about each projects in its folder (Russian language).
I hope this will help you in your studies. =)
